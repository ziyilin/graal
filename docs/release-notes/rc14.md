## 1.0-RC14
(2019-03-18)

##### Introducing `--vm.<option>`
We introduced a uniform `--vm.<option>` which allows to pass options in a uniform way, without knowing which VM mode (`--jvm`, or `--native`) will be used. It replaces  `--jvm.<option>` and `--native.<option>` command line options, e.g. the option to configure the maximum amount of memory used for the heap `--jvm.Xmx=5G` becomes `--vm.Xmx=5G`.
This applies to all languages.

### Java
##### libgraal
This is the first release to include a prebuilt [libgraal](https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/compiler#libgraal) shared library. This shared library is produced by the native-image and contains a pre-compiled version of the Graal compiler. In addition to improving startup, libgraal completely avoids interfering with the heap usage and profiling of the application code. That is, it has execution properties similar to other native HotSpot compilers such as C1 and C2. To try it out, add `-XX:+UseJVMCINativeCompiler` to your `java` command line. Note that this is still a work in progress and we are focusing on improving its stability and ensuring it does not compromise peak performance.

##### Default Failure Behavior
The default behavior has changed for a failure (i.e., uncaught exception) during the Graal compilation. These are now silently ignored and nothing is printed to the console. To get the old behavior of a message being printed to the console and for collecting diagnostics about the failure, you now need to specify `-Dgraal.CompilationFailureAction=Diagnose` option.

### Native Images
##### New Features
* Improved Native Image generation of various applications by fixing a number of issues occurring both at generation and run time.  

* Implemented the `Class.getSimpleName` method for the native images (see [1020](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/1020)).

##### Bugfixes
* Fixed an NPE during native image generation at accessing annotations metadata on the classes opened for reflection (see [1048](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/1048)).

* Fixed `createTempFile()` providing non-default filesystem and failing (see [1035](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/1035)).

* Fixed a segfault due to incorrect socket address length value (see [1025](https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/1025)).



### JavaScript
##### HTML-like Comments
We added support for [HTML-like comments](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-html-like-comments).
```javascript
var s = "Introducing html-like comments";
alert(s);
<!-- this is a comment -->
```
##### Changes
* Renamed the option `js.experimental-array-prototype` to `js.experimental-foreign-object-prototype`.

More details can be found in the [project changelog](https://github.com/graalvm/graaljs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc14) on GitHub.

### R

The GraalVM implementation of R in this release comes with various bug fixes and improvements.

##### Error Propagation
According to the R semantics, errors are handled immediately at the point where they are raised. However, in language embedding or polyglot scenarios, it is more useful to have the errors propagate out of the R scope, so that they can be handled correctly. We changed the behavior of FastR in this regard so that now R errors are propagated. Note that this only happens if this is possible without causing unexpected side effect in R code,
i.e., if there are no `options(error = ...)` or `on.exit(...)` handlers on the stack.

##### Experimental Options
All specific options (NOT those GNU-R compatible like `--save`) are experimental except for `--R.PrintErrorStacktracesToFile`, which is an option that enables logging of FastR internal errors for bug reporting purposes. Experimental options can be unlocked using `--experimental-options` or with `ContextBuilder#allowExperimentalOptions`.

To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project [changelog](https://github.com/oracle/fastr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10-rc-14).  


### Ruby

This version of GraalVM features new methods implementations and other updates for Ruby implementation.

##### New Features
* Implemented `Dir.children` and `Dir#children`, `String#delete_prefix`, `#delete_suffix` and related methods.

##### Changes

* `-Xlog=` has been removed. Use `--log.level=` instead.
* `-J` flag has been removed. Use `--vm.*` instead.
* `-J-cp lib.jar` and similar have been removed. You should use `--vm.cp=lib.jar` or `--vm.classpath=lib.jar` instead.
* The `-X` option now works as in MRI.

An extensive list of changes is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#10-rc-14).

### Python
##### Python 3.7.0
The standard library was updated to Python 3.7.0 from 3.6.5.
##### Changes
* Defined a subset of the `graalpython` launcher options as "stable". All other options are subject to change and need to be unlocked explicitly on the command line.
* Added the support for  `-I` flag to ignore the user environment and not add the working directory to `sys.path`.

More details can be found in the [project changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/graalvm/graalpython/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc14).

### LLVM Interpreter

* Various bug fixes.

### API changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)

##### New Features
* Added [Context.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions](http://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/org/graalvm/polyglot/Context.Builder.html#allowExperimentalOptions-boolean-) to control whether experimental options can be passed to a Context.
* Added [Engine.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions](http://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/org/graalvm/polyglot/Engine.Builder.html#allowExperimentalOptions-boolean-) to control whether experimental instrument and engine options can be passed.
* The [`@Option`](http://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/Option.html) annotation can now specify the stability of an option.
* Added engine bound `TruffleLogger` for instruments. The engine bound logger can be used by threads executing without any context.

##### Changes
* Multiple deprecated elements were removed from  the Truffle language implementation framework, i.e., `TruffleException.isTimeout`, `EventBinding.getFilter` etc..

We summarized the Truffle and Graal SDK changes between GraalVM versions in the separate changelogs:

- [Graal SDK changelog](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/sdk/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc14)
- [Truffle changelog](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/truffle/CHANGELOG.md#version-100-rc14)
